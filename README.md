## Feature Breakdown

The AirBnB Clone project is designed to replicate core features of the Airbnb platform. Below is a breakdown of the main features and their purpose.

### 1. User Management
- Provides user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Supports different user roles (guests and hosts) to enable property listing, booking, and reviewing.

### 2. Property Management
- Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings.
- Each property includes details such as title, description, location, images, price per night, and availability.

### 3. Booking System
- Guests can search for available properties based on filters (location, dates, price).
- Bookings include start and end dates, pricing details, and booking status (pending, confirmed, or cancelled).

### 4. Review & Rating System
- Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they‚Äôve booked.
- Reviews help maintain quality and trust within the platform by informing future guests.

### 5. Payment Integration
- Supports processing payments for bookings.
- Ensures secure transactions and maintains payment history tied to each booking.

### 6. Search & Filtering
- Allows users to search properties by location, date range, price, and amenities.
- Improves user experience by making it easy to find the right property quickly.

### 7. Admin Dashboard (optional/advanced feature)
- Provides administrators with tools to manage users, listings, and system-wide settings.
- Helps monitor platform activity, resolve disputes, and maintain overall system health.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical for protecting sensitive user data, financial transactions, and ensuring overall platform trust. The following measures will be implemented:

### 1. Authentication
- Users must log in with secure credentials before accessing the platform.
- Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) will be used to maintain session security.
- **Why:** Protects user accounts and prevents unauthorized access.

### 2. Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users can only access resources permitted to them (e.g., hosts manage their properties, admins manage all users).
- **Why:** Prevents unauthorized actions and enforces data ownership.

### 3. Data Encryption
- All communication between the client and server will use HTTPS/TLS.
- Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment details) will be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Why:** Protects against data theft and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
- Limits the number of API requests per user/IP within a time window.
- **Why:** Protects the system from brute-force attacks and denial-of-service (DoS).

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.
- **Why:** Ensures system integrity and protects against malicious input.

### 6. Secure Payments
- Payment operations will follow PCI-DSS compliance standards.
- **Why:** Ensures financial data is protected and transactions are processed securely.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software. They ensure rapid development cycles while maintaining quality and stability.

### Why CI/CD is Important
- **Automation:** Reduces manual errors by automating builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Faster Feedback:** Developers receive quick feedback on code changes, allowing rapid iteration.
- **Consistency:** Ensures each release goes through the same quality checks before reaching production.
- **Scalability:** Supports continuous delivery of new features without downtime.

### Tools We Can Use
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, linting, and deployment directly from the GitHub repo.
- **Docker:** Packages applications into containers to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **CI Services:** Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI could also be integrated as needed.
